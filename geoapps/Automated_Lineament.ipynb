    "# Tutorial 2: Automated Lineament Extraction\n",
    "In this tutorial we demosntrate how to extract lineament from gridded magnetic data in a semi-automated fashion. \n",
    "This application is NOT meant to replace the work of experts, but rather to provide a \"first guess\" from machine vision algorithms provided by the open-sourced [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) package.\n",
    "The main goals are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speed-up the interpretation of gravity and magnetic data\n",
    "- Promote reproducibility\n",
    "- Demonstrate the power of open-source technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example we have pre-computed the reduce-to-pole (RTP) magnetic data from Mount Dore, Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    " - See **User Notes** (below) for instructions on how to use the application. \n",
    " - [As seen on Youtube](https://youtu.be/Lpn3xA7xlBs)"

We can use the [skimage.feature.canny](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/edges/plot_canny.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-edges-plot-canny-py) algorithm to do this for us. The main parameter that controls this function is:\n",

We can use the [skimage.transform.hough_line](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/edges/plot_line_hough_transform.html?highlight=hough) algorithm to do the job. The main parameters to control the algorithm are:\n",
