In short
^^^^^^^^

The **geoapps** project has been created by `Mira Geoscience`_ for the development and sharing of open-source
applications in geoscience. Users will be able to directly leverage the powerful visualization capabilities of
`Geoscience ANALYST`_ along with open-source code from the Python ecosystem.
