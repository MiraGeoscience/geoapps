Low-level applications
======================

This section provides a list of low-level applications that can be combined
together to form more complex ones.


.. _objectdataselection:

Object, data selection
----------------------

Application for the selection an object and associated data from a target
geoh5.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from geoapps.selection import ObjectDataSelection

    # Create an instance with pointer to the target geoh5
    app = ObjectDataSelection(
        h5file="../assets/FlinFlon.geoh5",
        objects="Gravity_Magnetics_drape60m" # [Optional]
    )

    # Display the app
    app.widget


.. _plotselectiondata:

Plot and select data
--------------------

Application for the selection and downsampling of data in 2D plan view.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from geoapps.plotting import PlotSelection2D

    # Create an instance with pointer to the target geoh5
    app = PlotSelection2D(
        h5file="../assets/FlinFlon.geoh5",
        objects="Gravity_Magnetics_drape60m" # [Optional]
    )

    # Display the app
    app.widget

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
