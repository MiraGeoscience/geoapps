together to form more complex ones.


.. note:: Active widgets on this page are for demonstration only.

          The latest version of the application can be `downloaded here <https://github.com/MiraGeoscience/geoapps/archive/develop.zip>`_.

          See the :ref:`Installation page <getting_started>` to get started.


.. _workspaceselection:

Project panel
-------------

Application adapted from `ipyfilechoose <https://pypi.org/project/ipyfilechooser/>`_ for the selection of a workspace using


.. jupyter-execute::

    app = BaseApplication()
    app.project_panel

Select
^^^^^^
Prompts browsing menu

Create a copy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Make a working copy of the selected ``geoh5`` in place.


.. _trigger_panel:

Run and save
------------

.. jupyter-execute::

    from geoapps.base import BaseApplication

    app = BaseApplication()
    app.trigger_panel

Application for starting some computation and saving the output to ``geoh5``

Compute
^^^^^^^
Generic ToggleButton to trigger some function.

To Group
^^^^^^^^
Create a ``geoh5`` ``Group`` to store new objects created. Results added to the project ``Root`` if left empty.

GA Pro - Live link

Activate the live link mode for GA Pro users.


.. _objectdataselection:

Object, data selection
----------------------

.. jupyter-execute::

    from geoapps.selection import ObjectDataSelection
    app = ObjectDataSelection(

        objects="Gravity_Magnetics_drape60m" # [Optional]
    )
    app.widget

Application for the selection an object and associated data from a target
geoh5.


Objects
^^^^^^^
List of objects present in the target ``geoh5``

Data
^^^^
``Dropdown`` or ``SelectMultiple`` widget for the selection of data contained in the selected object



.. _plotselectiondata:

Plot and select data
--------------------

.. jupyter-execute::

    from geoapps.plotting import PlotSelection2D

    app = PlotSelection2D(h5file="../assets/FlinFlon.geoh5")
    app.widget

Application for the selection and downsampling of data in 2D plan view.


Parameters

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    from geoapps.selection import TopographyOptions
    app = TopographyOptions(h5file="../assets/FlinFlon.geoh5")
    app.options.disabled = True
    app.objects.value = "Topography"
    app.data.value = "Z"
    app.widget

Select an ``Object`` and ``Data`` defining x, y (from vertices or centroids) and vertical position.

Relative to Sensor
""""""""""""""""""

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    from geoapps.selection import TopographyOptions
