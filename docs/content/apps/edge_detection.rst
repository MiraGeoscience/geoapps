Edge Detection
==============

With this application, users can create lines along edges (lineaments) from gridded data in a
semi-automated fashion. The application uses machine vision algorithms from the `Scikit-Image
<https://scikit-image.org/>`_ open-source package.

.. image:: ./images/edge_detection.gif


- Currently available for Grid2D objects.
- Edges can be exported to `Geoscience ANALYST <https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst/>`_ for viewing and editing.
- See Methodology_ for algorithmic details

.. note:: Active widgets on this page are for demonstration only.

          The latest version of the application can be `downloaded here <https://github.com/MiraGeoscience/geoapps/archive/develop.zip>`_.

          See the :ref:`Installation page <getting_started>` to get started.

    )
    app.trigger_panel



.. _methodology:

Methodology
-----------

The conversion from raster data to lines involves the following four main processing steps.

.. figure:: ./images/edge_detection_algo.png
        :align: center
        :alt: inv_app


1. The selected gridded data are normalized between [0, 1]

2. Normalized values are processed with the Canny_ edge detection algorithm.

3. The full grid is sub-divided into overlapping square tiles defined by the
   `window size`_ parameter. Tiling is used to speed up computations and reduce
   skews in the Hough line parametrization observed on grids with small aspect ratios.

4. For each tile, edges are converted to a line parametric form using the `Hough Line Transform`_.
