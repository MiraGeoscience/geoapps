geoapps: Python applications for geoscientific problems
=======================================================


Welcome to **geoapps**! Where geoscientists meet to share open-source applications.

In short
^^^^^^^^

The **geoapps** has been created for the development of open-source
geoscientific applications in Python. Users will be able to directly leverage
the powerful visualization capabilities of `Geoscience ANALYST
<https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst/>`_
along with open-source code from the Python ecosystem.
